# STOCK-SAVVY

📈 STOCK SAVVY – Portfolio Optimization using Python
Overview
STOCK SAVVY is a Python-based data analysis project focused on portfolio optimization using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The goal is to identify the optimal combination of stocks that maximize returns while minimizing risk, based on historical performance data.
In this project, we analyze the stock market performance of four major Indian companies:
* Reliance Industries
* TCS (Tata Consultancy Services)
* Infosys
* HDFC Bank
Using Python libraries and financial modeling techniques, we construct an efficient portfolio with the best risk-adjusted return, measured by the Sharpe ratio.

📌 Objectives
* Analyze historical stock prices and trends.
* Calculate expected returns and volatilities.
* Measure correlations between different stocks to support diversification.
* Apply Modern Portfolio Theory to construct an optimal portfolio.
* Visualize the efficient frontier and identify the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.

🔧 Tools & Technologies
* Python
* yfinance – For real-time historical stock data retrieval.
* pandas – Data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy – Numerical operations.
* matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization.

📊 Key Results
* Developed an optimized portfolio from four selected stocks.
* Applied risk-return trade-off modeling using MPT.
* Achieved a Sharpe ratio of ~1.68, indicating a strong risk-adjusted return.

📚 Concepts Used
* Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) – Framework for building portfolios to maximize return for a given level of risk.
* Efficient Frontier – Graph representing portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk.
* Sharpe Ratio – A measure of risk-adjusted return.
